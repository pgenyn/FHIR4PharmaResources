# FHIR4PharmaResources
At fhir4pharma (www.phir4pharma.com), we are working towards a future where clinical care and research  work hand in hand to deliver the best healthcare outcomes. Our dedication to harnessing the potential of the FHIR standard together with our innovative methodologies is supporting the transformation of  the clinical trial process as we know it.

This respository contains related resources such as presentations and papers explaining how FHIR resources can be used to support trial specification (translating the protocol into FHIR resources) and direct data capture implementation (from eHR to Pharma).
